# Scissors Folia Agent Guide

## Scope

These instructions apply to the entire repository. Scissors Folia is a patch-based fork of Folia built with
paperweight. Paperweight applies Paper, then Folia, then Scissors. The files produced by applying patches are
development worktrees, not the repository's source of truth.

Read this file before changing code. Human setup and build instructions are in
`README.md`.

## Objective: eliminate exploits, do not soften them

Scissors exists to prevent exploit payloads from crashing clients or the server. A fix is complete only when the
malicious data is eliminated: stripped, discarded, or refused at the server boundary so it can never reach a client or
take effect. Making a failure look nicer is not a fix. Kicking the sender with a vague error, catching an exception
around a crash, or letting clients cope with bad data on their own all leave the payload alive and are incomplete.

Hold every exploit fix to these outcomes:

- Malicious data arriving from a client is discarded or sanitized where it enters, and the connection of a player who
  merely carries a bad item survives.
- Data already in world or player storage is sanitized before the server sends it, so pre-existing bad items cannot
  crash the clients that receive them.
- Strip the invalid part and keep the valid remainder when possible, rather than rejecting the whole interaction.
- The server logs what was eliminated and why, so operators can identify abuse without guessing at vague errors.

### Patch the root cause, not the reported instance

Assume the people who exploit these bugs are ruthless and will probe every path around a partial fix. A patch that only
covers the one vector you were shown will be re-exploited through the next one — a different packet, a different
component, a different code path that reaches the same sink. That is not a hypothetical; it is the default outcome.

- Find the class of bug, not the single case. If a malformed bundle crashes clients, ask what else carries nested items
  (containers, charged projectiles, any component the authoritative validator recurses into) and cover all of them.
- Fix at the narrowest point that every variant must pass through. Prefer a single authoritative chokepoint (for
  example, the outgoing item encode that every client-bound stack funnels through) over sprinkling checks at each
  call site. Before trusting a chokepoint, verify nothing bypasses it.
- Enumerate every ingress and egress for the payload: how it enters (packets, commands, NBT, plugins, world load), how
  it is stored, and how it leaves toward a client. A path you leave uncovered is a path that gets found.
- Never ship a fix with a known-but-unpatched hole and a note describing it. Documenting the gap hands the exploiter a
  map. Close it, or if it genuinely cannot be closed yet, treat that as an open vulnerability, not a finished patch.
- Match the mindset of the attacker, not the reporter: the reporter shows you one way in; the attacker will try all of
  them.

### Prove the sanitized remainder is safe

Removing the most obvious field is insufficient when the remaining object can still drive the same sink. Before
calling an exploit fixed:

- Trace the exact version's consumer through the client or server sink. Do not treat a suggestive flag, registry
  property, validation result, or method name as a safety contract until the call order proves it; a limiter applied
  after allocation or provider construction does not bound that work.
- Quantify every independent workload multiplier: cost per operation, operations per tick, radius/area or recursive
  fan-out, lifetime, creation rate, and the number of simultaneously active objects. Bound the combined workload, not
  only one multiplier.
- Run the original payload after sanitation and inspect the resulting object. If it is still huge, permanent,
  repeatable without cooldown, deeply nested, or otherwise able to reach the same resource budget, the patch is not
  complete.
- Test alternate implementations and parameterized variants, including values that are valid according to the codec.
  Prefer a small allowlist of audited behavior when a registry can grow or its entries have unrelated client costs.
- Check amplification through repetition. A safe-looking per-object cap can still fail when the original ingress can
  cheaply create hundreds of those objects; eliminate or rate-bound that ingress as well.
- Derive compatibility limits from the largest behavior vanilla actually creates in this version, then document any
  deliberate restriction to commands, plugins, APIs, or stored data.

## Version-scoped learnings

Before revisiting an exploit or subsystem, read `learnings/README.md` and the directory matching the exact `mcVersion`.
Treat notes from other Minecraft versions as leads only and revalidate them against the current sources.

## Project identity and upstream boundary

Scissors owns:

- The `scissors-folia` root project and the `scissors-api` and `scissors-server`
  modules.
- The `io.github.scissorsmc` Maven group.
- The `scissorsmc:scissors` runtime brand and the `Scissors` product name.
- Scissors-specific patches, source files, tests, and documentation.

Folia is the direct upstream and Paper remains Folia's upstream. Keep `Folia`, `Paper`, `paper-api`, `paper-server`,
`dev.folia`, `io.papermc`, upstream repositories, APIs, and Minecraft names where they describe upstream code or
compatibility. Do not perform blanket upstream-to-Scissors replacements. Preserve upstream copyright, license, and
attribution text.

The Folia commit is pinned by `foliaRef` in `gradle.properties`. That Folia commit determines the Paper commit beneath
it. Do not change either relationship unless the task is specifically an upstream update.

### Authoritative upstream source references

Use public source before reverse-engineering or decompiling build tooling:

- [Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia) is Scissors Folia's direct upstream. Resolve update behavior against the
  exact `foliaRef`, preferably through paperweight's local Folia checkout.
- [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) is Folia's upstream. Use the exact `paperRef` pinned by the selected Folia
  commit when investigating Paper-owned code; do not substitute Paper's current branch or Scissors' Paper pin.
- [paperweight](https://github.com/PaperMC/paperweight) is the authoritative source for patcher/core Gradle plugins,
  task behavior, and DSL types. Check a locally cached matching sources JAR or the source revision for the configured
  plugin version before inspecting bytecode.
- [paperweight-examples](https://github.com/PaperMC/paperweight-examples) provides official fork examples, but it is
  frequently behind current Paper, Folia, and paperweight behavior. Treat it as a lead and revalidate every task name
  and pattern against this repository's pinned versions.

When source is already available in a checkout, a `-sources.jar`, or one of these official repositories, do not
decompile the corresponding class or infer its behavior from an unrelated fork version.

## Updating Folia

Treat a Folia update as a patch rebase, not a dependency bump.

1. Confirm the root repository and every generated nested worktree are free of unrelated changes. Fold or commit all
   intended work before changing the upstream reference because patch application can replace generated worktrees.
2. Set `foliaRef` in `gradle.properties` to the full target Folia commit SHA.
3. If the target commit changes Minecraft versions, also copy `mcVersion` and `apiVersion` from the target Folia
   `gradle.properties`. Do not guess either value.
4. Compare the target Folia root build files, Gradle wrapper, Java/toolchain requirements, and paperweight configuration
   with this repository. Port only changes required to build the new target; retain Scissors project names, group,
   branding, repositories, and owned build behavior.
5. Run `./gradlew applyAllPatches`. Resolve failures in patch-set order:
    - Rebase rejected single-file build-script changes in the generated `scissors-*/build.gradle.kts`, then run
      `./gradlew rebuildFoliaSingleFilePatches`.
    - Resolve API conflicts in `paper-api/`, Paper-server conflicts in `paper-server/`, and Minecraft conflicts in
      `scissors-server/src/minecraft/`.
    - Preserve the reason for each Scissors patch. Drop a patch when Folia or Paper now provides the same behavior; do
      not retain an empty or redundant compatibility patch.
    - Use `applyFoliaSingleFilePatchesFuzzy` or `applyPaperApiFilePatchesFuzzy` only to recover changed context that is
      still semantically correct. For a Minecraft-version update,
      `applyOrMovePaperApiFilePatches` can move rejected API file patches aside for manual resolution.
6. Regenerate the tracked patch sets with the full patch-regeneration sequence below. Review every regenerated patch;
   an upstream update must not silently absorb unrelated Folia or Paper changes into a Scissors patch.
7. Run `./gradlew applyAllPatches` again from the regenerated tracked state, then run `./gradlew build`,
   `git diff --check`, and `git diff`.

Use `.\gradlew.bat` for every Gradle command on Windows PowerShell. An update commit should contain the new
`foliaRef`, any required version or build-tooling changes, and all regenerated Scissors patches needed for that exact
Folia commit.

## Repository model

| Path                             | Purpose                                                                                                | Commit it? |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `scissors-api/`                  | Scissors API build patch, patches, and directly owned API source                                       | Yes        |
| `scissors-server/`               | Scissors server build patch, Paper-server patches, Minecraft patches, and directly owned server source | Yes        |
| `paper-api/`                     | Applied API worktree generated by paperweight                                                          | No         |
| `paper-server/`                  | Applied Paper-server worktree generated by paperweight                                                 | No         |
| `scissors-server/src/minecraft/` | Applied Minecraft worktree and nested Git repository                                                   | No         |
| `scissors-*/build.gradle.kts`    | Generated patched build scripts                                                                        | No         |
| `build/`, `.gradle/`, `run/`     | Build/runtime output                                                                                   | No         |

The ignored worktrees are where existing upstream files are edited. The durable result must be regenerated into tracked
files under `scissors-api/` or
`scissors-server/`.

New Scissors-owned classes that do not replace an upstream file may be added directly under the applicable module's
`src/main/java` or `src/test/java`.

## Before editing

1. Run `git status --short` and preserve unrelated user changes.
2. Read `gradle.properties`, `build.gradle.kts`, and the relevant module patch directories.
3. Apply patches:

   ```shell
   ./gradlew applyAllPatches
   ```

   On Windows PowerShell, use `.\gradlew.bat` instead of `./gradlew`.
4. Choose the correct layer before editing:
    - Public API: `paper-api/`
    - Paper/CraftBukkit implementation: `paper-server/`
    - Mojang/Minecraft source: `scissors-server/src/minecraft/`
    - Scissors-owned new source: `scissors-api/src/...` or
      `scissors-server/src/...`
    - Build wiring: the generated module build script, then rebuild its single-file patch

Do not start `runServer`, `runDevServer`, `runPaperclip`, or any other server or watch task. Use terminating builds and
tests only.

## Patch workflow

Applied patch worktrees are nested Git repositories. Root-repository Git commands do not commit edits inside them.

### Small per-file changes

Use a file patch for a focused change to an existing upstream file.

1. Edit the file in the applied worktree.
2. Inspect the nested repository's diff.
3. Fold the tracked change into that patch set's `file` commit with its
   `fixup...FilePatches` Gradle task.
4. Rebuild the applicable patch set.
5. Review the generated tracked `.patch` file from the repository root.

Common task pairs are:

| Layer        | Fix up file patches            | Rebuild patches             |
|--------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| API          | `fixupPaperApiFilePatches`     | `rebuildFoliaPatches`       |
| Paper server | `fixupPaperServerFilePatches`  | `rebuildPaperServerPatches` |
| Minecraft    | `fixupMinecraftSourcePatches`  | `rebuildMinecraftPatches`   |

If a task name changes with paperweight, use
`./gradlew tasks --group patching` and select the task for the named patch set. The server-side fixup tasks live in the
server subproject and are not listed by the root patching group; find them with
`./gradlew :scissors-server:tasks --all`.

### Feature patches

Use a feature patch when a coherent change spans multiple upstream files, benefits from its own commit message, or
should be independently reorderable or droppable during an upstream update.

1. Edit the applied worktree.
2. In that nested worktree, stage only the intended files.
3. Commit with a concise subject explaining the behavior and a body explaining the reason or important maintenance
   constraints.
4. Rebuild the applicable patch set.
5. Confirm the new mail-formatted patch appears under that patch set's
   `features/` directory.

Example:

```shell
git -C paper-server status --short
git -C paper-server add src/main/java/example/ChangedFile.java
git -C paper-server commit
./gradlew rebuildPaperServerPatches
```

Do not use a feature patch for unrelated edits. Do not hand-edit generated patches as the normal workflow; edit the
applied source and regenerate them.

### Amending an existing patch

Extend an existing patch instead of creating a new one when the change belongs to the same logical fix.

File patches need no special amend step: edit the applied file again and rerun that layer's fixup task. Every file
patch in a layer lives in the same `file` commit, so the fixup folds the new change in and the rebuild regenerates the
per-file `.patch` content. This is also the way to extend an existing fix to an additional upstream file in the same
layer.

To amend an existing feature patch, rewrite its commit in the nested worktree:

1. Edit the applied worktree and stage only the intended files.
2. If the feature commit is the tip of the nested worktree, run `git commit --amend --no-edit`, or drop `--no-edit`
   when the patch message must change. Otherwise, autosquash a fixup commit into it non-interactively:

   ```shell
   git -C paper-server commit --fixup <feature-commit-sha>
   git -C paper-server -c sequence.editor=: rebase -i --autosquash <feature-commit-sha>~1
   ```

3. Rebuild the applicable patch set and review the regenerated patch under `features/` from the repository root; the
   diff should show only the intended amendment.

### Full patch regeneration

When a change crosses layers, or before final verification, use the complete downstream sequence:

```shell
./gradlew rebuildFoliaPatches
./gradlew rebuildPaperServerPatches
./gradlew rebuildServerPatches
./gradlew rebuildMinecraftPatches
```

Run the commands as separate invocations and stop on the first failure. On Windows, substitute `.\gradlew.bat`.

Before reapplying patches, ensure all intended nested-worktree changes have either been folded into file patches or
committed as feature patches. Reapplying can replace generated worktrees.

Regeneration can mechanically change patch hunk line numbers and `index` hashes when an earlier patch shifts the
applied source. If a tracked patch differs only in those line numbers or hashes, ignore that diff. Do not rewrite,
restore, unstage, or otherwise chase it merely to make the working tree show only semantic changes; leave the
regenerated metadata as-is.

## Patch quality

- Keep one logical change per feature patch.
- Explain why a patch exists, not merely what the diff does.
- Match the style of the upstream file. Avoid unrelated formatting.
- In Minecraft source, mark non-obvious Scissors changes with concise
  `// Scissors - ...` comments. Use start/end markers only when they improve patch readability.
- Prefer fully qualified names for occasional references added to Minecraft source; import churn causes avoidable
  upstream conflicts.
- Add or update API and implementation together when behavior is public.
- Add tests in the layer whose behavior changed when practical. Do not add a new test framework.
- Never edit generated sources just to silence a build unless the resulting tracked patch is intentional.

## Verification

Use the narrowest relevant check first, then verify the complete patch state:

```shell
./gradlew applyAllPatches
./gradlew build
```

For documentation-only changes, patch application is sufficient when the build configuration did not change. For build,
API, server, or Minecraft changes, run the build.

The `build` task verifies the modules but does not create a standalone server. When a task changes distribution packaging,
requires a runnable artifact, or will be handed to the user for interactive runtime testing, also run:

```shell
./gradlew :scissors-server:createPaperclipJar
```

The deployable artifact is `scissors-server/build/libs/scissors-paperclip-<version>.jar`.
`scissors-server-<version>.jar` is a thin development JAR and must not be used as a standalone server.
For a runtime-testing handoff, create the Paperclip JAR after the intended changes reach their final patch state so the
user does not need to build it. This task is not required for intermediate build or test cycles.

After verification:

1. Run `git status --short`.
2. Review every tracked patch with `git diff --check` and `git diff`.
3. Confirm generated worktrees and build outputs are not staged.
4. State exactly which commands passed. If a check could not run, report the command and error.

## Safety

- Do not discard, reset, or overwrite unrelated work in the root or nested Git repositories.
- Do not update Folia, Paper, Gradle, paperweight, Java, mappings, or dependencies unless requested.
- Do not publish artifacts, push branches, create releases, or modify external services unless requested.
- Do not run a Minecraft server as verification. Hand the run command to the user when interactive runtime testing is
  required.
